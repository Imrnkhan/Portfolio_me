Hello! Interestingly, I have been a student of Maths in my high school and got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Rajasthan Technical University](https://www.rtu.ac.in/). My interest in coding started back in 2020 during Final year of B.tech . Since then, I started learning programming languages & solving problems based on data structure and algorithms. Most importantly I'm a [Problem Solver](https://leetcode.com/u/imrankhan7581/).

Today, I'm currently pursuing my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication and Engineering (2016-2020) with [8.59 GPA aggregate].

Also I've knowledge of Web Development and created some projects on that using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate / Javascript / HTML, MySQL and some other cool libraries and frameworks. I'm also part of some student organisations and Leading one of them.

Here is a list of the technologies that I've worked with.
